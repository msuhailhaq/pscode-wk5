// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

// Assuming you want to add 4 and 8 
sum = 4 + 8

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Assuming you want to check if 5 is even or odd
if (5 % 2 ==0) {
	result = "Even"
} else {
	result = "Odd"
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    


// a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
for i = 1 to 5 do
    read number[i]
end for

// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
total = 0
for i = 1 to 5 do
    total = total + number[i]
end for
average = total / 5

// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
min = number[1]
max = number[1]
for i = 2 to 5 do
    if number[i] < min then
        min = number[i]
    end if
    if number[i] > max then
        max = number[i]
    end if
end for

// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
write "The average is " + average
write "The minimum is " + min
write "The maximum is " + max
